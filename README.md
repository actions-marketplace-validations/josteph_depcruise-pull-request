# Depcruise PR Check - GitHub Actions

## What is it ?

GitHub action to comment [depcruise](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) report to a pull request, also provides an optional status check for the job.

## Usage

### Classic usage

```yml
on: pull_request

jobs:
  example_depcruise_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: An example job to comment depcruise report to a PR
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Depcruise
        uses: josteph/depcruise-pull-request@v1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Specifying which pull request to comment on

You can explicitly input which pull request should be commented on by passing the `pr_number` input.
That is particularly useful for manual workflow for instance (`workflow_run`).

```yml
...
- name: Depcruise
  uses: josteph/depcruise-pull-request@v1
  with:
    pr_number: 100 # This will comment on pull request #100
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Specifying baseDir and depcruise config file

You can also override the `baseDir` and depcruise config file path. The path must be relative to root directory.

```yml
...
- name: Depcruise
  uses: josteph/depcruise-pull-request@v1
  with:
    depcruise_base_dir: 'packages/monorepo-a'
    depcruise_config: 'packages/monorepo-a/.dependency-cruiser.js'
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
